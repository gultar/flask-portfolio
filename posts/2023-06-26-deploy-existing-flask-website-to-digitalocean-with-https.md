# How to Deploy an Existing Flask Website to DigitalOcean with HTTPS?

*Published on 2023-06-26*

Are you looking to deploy your existing Flask website to DigitalOcean with HTTPS? In this blog post, we will provide you with a detailed guide on how to accomplish this task. We have gathered information from various sources, including tutorials provided by DigitalOcean, to ensure that you have all the necessary steps to successfully deploy your Flask website with HTTPS.

## Step 1: Create a Droplet on DigitalOcean and Install Nginx and Certbot

The first step in deploying your Flask website to DigitalOcean with HTTPS is to create a Droplet on DigitalOcean. A Droplet is a virtual machine that will host your website. Once you have created the Droplet, you will need to install Nginx and Certbot. Nginx is a web server that will serve your Flask application, and Certbot is a tool that will help you obtain an SSL certificate for HTTPS.

## Step 2: Configure Nginx to Serve the Flask Application and Obtain an SSL Certificate

After installing Nginx and Certbot, you will need to configure Nginx to serve your Flask application. This involves creating a server block in the Nginx configuration file and specifying the location of your Flask application. Additionally, you will need to obtain an SSL certificate from Certbot to enable HTTPS for your website. Certbot will automatically configure Nginx to use the SSL certificate.

## Step 3: Update DNS Records and Test the Website

Once you have configured Nginx and obtained an SSL certificate, you will need to update the DNS records for your domain to point to the IP address of your Droplet. This will ensure that users can access your website using your domain name. Finally, you should test the website to ensure that it is working properly. Open your browser and enter your domain name with "https://" to see if your Flask website loads securely.

By following these steps, you can deploy your existing Flask website to DigitalOcean with HTTPS. This will provide improved security and accessibility for your users. Remember to refer to the detailed documentation and tutorials provided by DigitalOcean for more information and troubleshooting tips.

We hope this guide has been helpful in assisting you with deploying your Flask website to DigitalOcean with HTTPS. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to the DigitalOcean community or consult their support resources. Happy deploying!

## Step 4: Link a Domain Name to the Droplet

To link a domain name to your Droplet on DigitalOcean, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the IP address of your Droplet. You can find it in the DigitalOcean control panel or by running the command `ifconfig` on your Droplet.

2. Go to the website of your domain registrar (the company where you purchased the domain name) and log in to your account.

3. Locate the DNS management or domain settings for your domain name. This section may be called "DNS Management," "Domain Settings," or something similar.

4. Create an "A" record or edit an existing one. An "A" record associates a domain name with an IP address. If there is already an "A" record, edit it and replace the existing IP address with the IP address of your Droplet. If there is no "A" record, create a new one by specifying the following information:
   - Name/Host/Alias: Enter the subdomain or leave it blank to link the entire domain.
   - TTL (Time to Live): The time duration for the DNS record to be cached. You can set it to a lower value if you anticipate changing the IP address in the future.
   - Type: Select "A" from the dropdown menu.
   - Value/Address/Destination: Enter the IP address of your Droplet.

5. Save the changes. The DNS changes may take some time to propagate across the internet, so it might not take effect immediately. Typically, it can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours.

6. Verify the DNS propagation. You can use online tools like `dnschecker.org` or `whatsmydns.net` to check if the DNS changes have propagated and the domain is pointing to the correct IP address.

Once the DNS propagation is complete, your domain name will be linked to your Droplet. You can access your Flask website using your domain name in the browser with "https://" to verify that it loads securely.

Note: If you're using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) or other third-party services, you may need to configure additional settings to ensure proper domain linking and SSL certificate configuration.

Congratulations! You have successfully linked your domain name to your Droplet on DigitalOcean. Now your Flask website should be accessible using your domain name with HTTPS.
