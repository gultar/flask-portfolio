## Profile
I have a natural affinity for languages, and I truly love to deepen my understanding of expressions in both French and English. More than just a job, translation is a labour of love for me, and thatâ€™s why I chose to pursue a career in this field.

## Skills
- Translation: I translate administrative, economical and promotional content. Iâ€™ve also gained expertise in translating Twitter and Facebook publications.
- Web Localization: Mastering the art of combining business and pleasure. Iâ€™m completely at ease working in code, and translating a website is a piece of cake.
- Web Development: For me, code is art and I can spend many a sleepless night fixing bugs just so I can have the satisfaction of seeing my project work.
