## Projects 📚

Here is a brief overview of the projects I've been working on lately:

### [Auto-Researcher - Automated Research Tool 📚](/projects/auto-researcher)
The Research coding project is a powerful tool that streamlines the process of conducting research on a specific topic. By utilizing the Google Search API or Duck Duck Go Search API, it retrieves relevant search results and identifies the top articles based on a given query. I

t then extracts the content from these articles, generates summaries, and compiles them into a comprehensive blog post. The function also provides translation capabilities, allowing users to translate the generated content from English to French, for example. Overall, the Research function automates the research process, saves time, and produces high-quality, informative blog posts on any desired subject.
